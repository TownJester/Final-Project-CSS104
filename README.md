All content still needs to be added.
- All homepage content
- Creature logs
- Video needs to be edited (too long to upload).
Decided to cut out the logs and focus on the form for now.
Reason for this is the similarity the logs have to both websites. Forms would be completely different from the two sites in both function and looks.
Also, I do not have the time to finish both the form and logs in a way that I would be satified with.
Need to finish the form as a whole.
However, a decent amount of this is finished despite the fact that I wanted to do more.
